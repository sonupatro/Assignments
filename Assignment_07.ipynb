    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Raw string notation keeps regular expression meaningful and confusion free. Without it every backslash(' \\ ') in regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "It returns a match object if there is a match else returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "group() method returns the actual string that match the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover?Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Group zero is the entire match . group 0 covers (\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "group 1 covers the first set of parentheses. group 1 covers (\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "group 2 covers the second set of parentheses. group 2 covers (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "Ans- Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash:"

    "7.The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",

    "8.In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "It means either or\n",

    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "{4} means preceding character is to be repeated 4 times.\n",
    "{4,5} means preceding character is repeated minimum 4 times and maximum 5 times.\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\\d returns a match where string contains digit(number from 0-9)\n",
    "\\w returns a match where string contains any word character(character from a to Z, digit from 0 to 9 and underscore character)\n",
    "\\s returns a match where string contains a whitespace character.\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",

    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "' . ' character normally pass any character except newline character. With the help of DOTALL, ' . ' character can match any character including newline.\n",

    "Ans-\n",
    "It allows to write regular expressin that look nicer and are more readable by allowing visually separate logical section of the pattern and add comments.\n",

This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
