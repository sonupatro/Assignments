    "Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory By using next() function we can iterate the output of generator function"

    "1.List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
