    "\n",
    "2.Speed: The array package provides fast and efficient operations for reading, writing and accessing array elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Limited Data Types: The array package supports only a limited set of data types, including integers and floating-point numbers. It does not support other data types such as strings or objects.\n",

    "3.No Built-in Methods: The array package does not provide many of the built-in methods and functions that are available for lists, such as sort, append, insert, etc. You have to write custom code to perform these operations on arrays.\n",
