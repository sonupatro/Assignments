    "\n",
    "2.Using the \"import ... as\" statement: You can use the \"import ... as\" statement to give an alias to a module, which can help to resolve circular importing. For example, you can import module A as \"mod_a\" and module B as \"mod_b\", and then refer to them as \"mod_a\" and \"mod_b\" in the code, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Splitting a module into smaller modules: If you have a large module that is causing circular importing, you can split it into smaller modules. This will help to break the circular importing and make the code more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Using functions and classes instead of modules: You can use functions and classes to encapsulate related functionality and avoid circular importing. You can then import the required functions or classes in the main script or in other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Using \"lazy importing\": You can use \"lazy importing\", which means importing a module only when it is needed. This way, you can avoid circular importing and improve the performance of your program.\n",
