    "A probability distribution is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take. It assigns probabilities to each of these values, indicating how often we can expect to see them in repeated trials of an experiment. Although the values are meant to be random, a probability distribution can still provide information about their expected behavior, such as the average or most likely outcome. It is important to note that the actual values observed will vary each time the experiment is conducted, but the probability distribution provides a basis for predicting the overall pattern of results."

Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated by algorithms that use mathematical formulas to produce sequences of numbers that appear random, but are actually deterministic.\n",

In many applications, such as simulations or cryptography, the randomness of the numbers generated is not as important as their unpredictability, which pseudo-random numbers can provide. Additionally, generating truly random numbers can be expensive and time-consuming, whereas pseudo-random numbers can be generated quickly and efficiently."
